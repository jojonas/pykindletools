Description
-----------
Most of todays web sites use fancy design and scripting to provide the best user experience. While this is a good thing for web browsers, converters for ebook readers (like Amazon's `kindlegen`) expect a simple HTML input with only the basic HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs and special elements like page breaks. 
Additionally, ebook converters work with a lot of meta-information, eg. the table of contents.

This project aims to provide a "preprocessor" for the `kindlegen` application, written in Python, working on serveral web APIs.

Supported Web services
----------------------
 * Reddit (http://www.reddit.com, via `praw` module)
 * RSS Feeds
 * Wikipedia (via `wikipedia` module)
 * Wordpress (XML-RPC)

Requirements
------------
The project is (as of now) aimed at and tested with Python 2.7.5 and `kindlegen` on Windows, version 2.9.

For the different web services listed above, there might be dependencies. Here is a list of their project sites:
 * `praw` - Python Reddit API Wrapper, https://github.com/praw-dev/praw
 * `wikipedia` - A Pythonic wrapper for the Wikipedia API, https://github.com/goldsmith/Wikipedia
 
Installation & Usage
--------------------
It is recommended to place the `kindlegen` executable (which can be downloaded on [Amazons web page]{http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211}) in the project's root folder. Otherwise the wrappers have to be called with the `-k` parameter to specifiy the executables location.

The `kg_*.py` files in the root directory are supposed to be a command line interface to the underlying libraries. One can call each wrapper with the `--help` parameter to get more information about the calling syntax.
The output file name is generated by the library and cannot (yet) be configured, it is generated from the content.

Future
------
The goal is to include more web apis and to test and port the code to other operating systems and Python versions.
